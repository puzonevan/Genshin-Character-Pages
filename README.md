## Overview 
There are plenty of information sites about Genshin Impact, the characters, game statistics, etc. However, my information site about the characters in the game focuses on **only the characters** and showcases only what most players need which are **materials**, **builds**, and **ability descriptions**. 

### Inspiration Sites
- [Genshin Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki)

## Design 
Each character is divided into 5 sections: 
1. Title    
    The title section includes the ***name*** of the character as the main title, a ***sub title***, and sometimes a ***randomized quote*** by the character

2. Materials    
    This section includes the necessary ***materials*** and ***amounts*** in order to ***level up*** the character and their ablities to the max 

3. Builds   
    There are two builds containing ***weapons*** and ***artifacts*** that the character should use in the game

4. Abilities    
    This section includes ***abilities***(including ***passives***) and ***constellations*** of the character

5. Images   
    Lastly, why not include some ***fan art*** of the character.
